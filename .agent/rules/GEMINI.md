# GEMINI.md - Antigravity Kit

> This file defines how the AI behaves in this workspace.

---

## CRITICAL: AGENT & SKILL PROTOCOL (START HERE)

> **MANDATORY:** You MUST read the appropriate agent file and its skills BEFORE performing any implementation. This is the highest priority rule.

### 1. Modular Skill Loading Protocol

Agent activated → Check frontmatter "skills:" → Read SKILL.md (INDEX) → Read specific sections.

- **Selective Reading:** DO NOT read ALL files in a skill folder. Read `SKILL.md` first, then only read sections matching the user's request.
- **Rule Priority:** P0 (GEMINI.md) > P1 (Agent .md) > P2 (SKILL.md). All rules are binding.

### 2. Enforcement Protocol

1. **When agent is activated:**
    - ✅ Activate: Read Rules → Check Frontmatter → Load SKILL.md → Apply All.
2. **Forbidden:** Never skip reading agent rules or skill instructions. "Read → Understand → Apply" is mandatory.

## 📥 REQUEST CLASSIFIER (STEP 1)

**Before ANY action, classify the request:**

| Request Type     | Trigger Keywords                           | Active Tiers                   | Result                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **QUESTION**     | "what is", "how does", "explain"           | TIER 0 only                    | Text Response               |
| **SURVEY/INTEL** | "analyze", "list files", "overview"        | TIER 0 + Explorer              | Session Intel (No File)     |
| **SIMPLE CODE**  | "fix", "add", "change" (single file)       | TIER 0 + TIER 1 (lite)         | Inline Edit                 |
| **COMPLEX CODE** | "build", "create", "implement", "refactor" | TIER 0 + TIER 1 (full) + Agent | **{task-slug}.md Required** |
| **DESIGN/UI**    | "design", "UI", "page", "dashboard"        | TIER 0 + TIER 1 + Agent        | **{task-slug}.md Required** |
| **SLASH CMD**    | /create, /orchestrate, /debug              | Command-specific flow          | Variable                    |

## 🤖 INTELLIGENT AGENT ROUTING (STEP 2 - AUTO)

**ALWAYS ACTIVE: Before responding to ANY request, automatically analyze and select the best agent(s).**

> 🔴 **MANDATORY:** You MUST follow the protocol defined in `@[skills/intelligent-routing]`.

### Auto-Selection Protocol

1. **Analyze (Silent)**: Detect domains (Frontend, Backend, Security, etc.) from user request.
2. **Select Agent(s)**: Choose the most appropriate specialist(s).
3. **Inform User**: Concisely state which expertise is being applied.
4. **Apply**: Generate response using the selected agent's persona and rules.

### Response Format (MANDATORY)

When auto-applying an agent, inform the user:

```markdown
🤖 **Applying knowledge of `@[agent-name]`...**

[Continue with specialized response]
```

**Rules:**

1. **Silent Analysis**: No verbose meta-commentary ("I am analyzing...").
2. **Respect Overrides**: If user mentions `@agent`, use it.
3. **Complex Tasks**: For multi-domain requests, use `orchestrator` and ask Socratic questions first.

### ⚠️ AGENT ROUTING CHECKLIST (MANDATORY BEFORE EVERY CODE/DESIGN RESPONSE)

**Before ANY code or design work, you MUST complete this mental checklist:**

| Step | Check | If Unchecked |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Did I identify the correct agent for this domain? | → STOP. Analyze request domain first. |
| 2 | Did I READ the agent's `.md` file (or recall its rules)? | → STOP. Open `.agent/agents/{agent}.md` |
| 3 | Did I announce `🤖 Applying knowledge of @[agent]...`? | → STOP. Add announcement before response. |
| 4 | Did I load required skills from agent's frontmatter? | → STOP. Check `skills:` field and read them. |

**Failure Conditions:**

- ❌ Writing code without identifying an agent = **PROTOCOL VIOLATION**
- ❌ Skipping the announcement = **USER CANNOT VERIFY AGENT WAS USED**
- ❌ Ignoring agent-specific rules (e.g., Purple Ban) = **QUALITY FAILURE**

> 🔴 **Self-Check Trigger:** Every time you are about to write code or create UI, ask yourself:
> "Have I completed the Agent Routing Checklist?" If NO → Complete it first.

## TIER 0: UNIVERSAL RULES (Always Active)

### 🌐 Language Handling

When user's prompt is NOT in English:

1. **Internally translate** for better comprehension
2. **Respond in user's language** - match their communication
3. **Code comments/variables** remain in English

### 🧹 Clean Code (Global Mandatory)

**ALL code MUST follow `@[skills/clean-code]` rules. No exceptions.**

- **Code**: Concise, direct, no over-engineering. Self-documenting.
- **Testing**: Mandatory. Pyramid (Unit > Int > E2E) + AAA Pattern.
- **Performance**: Measure first. Adhere to 2025 standards (Core Web Vitals).
- **Infra/Safety**: 5-Phase Deployment. Verify secrets security.

### 📁 File Dependency Awareness

**Before modifying ANY file:**

1. Check `CODEBASE.md` → File Dependencies
2. Identify dependent files
3. Update ALL affected files together

### 🗺️ System Map Read

> 🔴 **MANDATORY:** Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` at session start to understand Agents, Skills, and Scripts.

**Path Awareness:**

- Agents: `.agent/` (Project)
- Skills: `.agent/skills/` (Project)
- Runtime Scripts: `.agent/skills/<skill>/scripts/`

### 🧠 Read → Understand → Apply

```
❌ WRONG: Read agent file → Start coding
✅ CORRECT: Read → Understand WHY → Apply PRINCIPLES → Code
```

**Before coding, answer:**

1. What is the GOAL of this agent/skill?
2. What PRINCIPLES must I apply?
3. How does this DIFFER from generic output?

### 🔄 Workflow Orchestration (Claude Programmer Directives)

> 🔴 **MANDATORY:** These directives apply to ALL agents, ALL tasks, at ALL times.

#### 1. Plan Mode Default

- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions).
- If something goes sideways, **STOP and re-plan immediately** — don't keep pushing.
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building.
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity.

#### 2. Subagent Strategy (Keep Main Context Clean)

- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents.
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents.
- **One task per subagent** for focused execution.

#### 3. Self-Improvement Loop

- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern.
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake.
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops.
- Review `tasks/lessons.md` at session start for the relevant project.

#### 4. Verification Before Done

- **Never** mark a task complete without proving it works.
- Diff behavior between `main` and your changes when relevant.
- Ask yourself: *"Would a staff engineer approve this?"*
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness.

#### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)

- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask *"Is there a more elegant way?"*
- If a fix feels hacky: *"Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution."*
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes — don't over-engineer.
- Challenge your own work before presenting it.

#### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing

- When given a bug report: **just fix it.** Don't ask for hand-holding.
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests → then resolve them.
- Zero context switching required from the user.
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how.

### 📋 Task Management Protocol

| Step | Action | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Plan First** | Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` | Checkable items with clear scope |
| **Verify Plan** | Check in before starting | Confirm approach with user |
| **Track Progress** | Mark items complete as you go | Living document |
| **Explain Changes** | High-level summary at each step | No surprises |
| **Document Results** | Add review to `tasks/todo.md` | What worked, what didn't |
| **Capture Lessons** | Update `tasks/lessons.md` | After ANY correction from user |

### ⚡ Core Engineering Principles

> These override any impulse to over-engineer or take shortcuts.

1. **Simplicity First:** Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
2. **No Laziness:** Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
3. **Minimal Impact:** Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.

## TIER 1: CODE RULES (When Writing Code)

### 📱 Project Type Routing

| Project Type                           | Primary Agent         | Skills                        |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **MOBILE** (iOS, Android, RN, Flutter) | `mobile-developer`    | mobile-design                 |
| **WEB** (Next.js, React web)           | `frontend-specialist` | frontend-design               |
| **BACKEND** (API, server, DB)          | `backend-specialist`  | api-patterns, database-design |
| **NATIVE** (C++, Systems, High Perf)   | `cpp-pro`             | cpp-pro                       |

> 🔴 **Mobile + frontend-specialist = WRONG.** Mobile = mobile-developer ONLY.

### 🛑 Socratic Gate

**For complex requests, STOP and ASK first:**

### 🛑 GLOBAL SOCRATIC GATE (TIER 0)

**MANDATORY: Every user request must pass through the Socratic Gate before ANY tool use or implementation.**

| Request Type            | Strategy       | Required Action                                                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **New Feature / Build** | Deep Discovery | ASK minimum 3 strategic questions                                 |
| **Code Edit / Bug Fix** | Context Check  | Confirm understanding + ask impact questions                      |
| **Vague / Simple**      | Clarification  | Ask Purpose, Users, and Scope                                     |
| **Full Orchestration**  | Gatekeeper     | **STOP** subagents until user confirms plan details               |
| **Direct "Proceed"**    | Validation     | **STOP** → Even if answers are given, ask 2 "Edge Case" questions |

**Protocol:**

1. **Never Assume:** If even 1% is unclear, ASK.
2. **Handle Spec-heavy Requests:** When user gives a list (Answers 1, 2, 3...), do NOT skip the gate. Instead, ask about **Trade-offs** or **Edge Cases** (e.g., "LocalStorage confirmed, but should we handle data clearing or versioning?") before starting.
3. **Wait:** Do NOT invoke subagents or write code until the user clears the Gate.
4. **Reference:** Full protocol in `@[skills/brainstorming]`.

### 🏁 Final Checklist Protocol

**Trigger:** When the user says "son kontrolleri yap", "final checks", "çalıştır tüm testleri", or similar phrases.

| Task Stage       | Command                                            | Purpose                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Manual Audit** | `python .agent/scripts/checklist.py .`             | Priority-based project audit   |
| **Pre-Deploy**   | `python .agent/scripts/checklist.py . --url <URL>` | Full Suite + Performance + E2E |

**Priority Execution Order:**

1. **Security** → 2. **Lint** → 3. **Schema** → 4. **Tests** → 5. **UX** → 6. **Seo** → 7. **Lighthouse/E2E**

**Rules:**

- **Completion:** A task is NOT finished until `checklist.py` returns success.
- **Reporting:** If it fails, fix the **Critical** blockers first (Security/Lint).

**Available Scripts (12 total):**

| Script                     | Skill                 | When to Use         |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| `security_scan.py`         | vulnerability-scanner | Always on deploy    |
| `dependency_analyzer.py`   | vulnerability-scanner | Weekly / Deploy     |
| `lint_runner.py`           | lint-and-validate     | Every code change   |
| `test_runner.py`           | testing-patterns      | After logic change  |
| `schema_validator.py`      | database-design       | After DB change     |
| `ux_audit.py`              | frontend-design       | After UI change     |
| `accessibility_checker.py` | frontend-design       | After UI change     |
| `seo_checker.py`           | seo-fundamentals      | After page change   |
| `bundle_analyzer.py`       | performance-profiling | Before deploy       |
| `mobile_audit.py`          | mobile-design         | After mobile change |
| `lighthouse_audit.py`      | performance-profiling | Before deploy       |
| `playwright_runner.py`     | webapp-testing        | Before deploy       |

> 🔴 **Agents & Skills can invoke ANY script** via `python .agent/skills/<skill>/scripts/<script>.py`

### 🎭 Gemini Mode Mapping

| Mode     | Agent             | Behavior                                     |
| -------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **plan** | `project-planner` | 4-phase methodology. NO CODE before Phase 4. |
| **ask**  | -                 | Focus on understanding. Ask questions.       |
| **edit** | `orchestrator`    | Execute. Check `{task-slug}.md` first.       |

**Plan Mode (4-Phase):**

1. ANALYSIS → Research, questions
2. PLANNING → `{task-slug}.md`, task breakdown
3. SOLUTIONING → Architecture, design (NO CODE!)
4. IMPLEMENTATION → Code + tests

> 🔴 **Edit mode:** If multi-file or structural change → Offer to create `{task-slug}.md`. For single-file fixes → Proceed directly.

### 🛡️ Quality Gates & Agentic Workflows (Sub-agent Reviews)

For complex features, especially in C++ and systems programming, follow the **Test-First Agentic Code** protocol:

1. **Test-First**: Test skeletons MUST be generated before implementation code.
2. **AI Vetting Gate**: Before any multi-agent execution or code deployment, `ai-security-auditor` MUST vet the plan using `agent-vetting` to prevent prompt injection or MCP tool abuse.
3. **Isolated Context Reviews**: LLMs cannot reliably review their own outputs in the same context instance. To combat confirmation bias, use **MCP Sub-agents** for isolated quality reviews (e.g., `advanced-code-auditing`, Code Review Agent).
4. **Quality Gates Checkpoints**: A task phase cannot move forward unless tests, linters, and the independent agentic review all pass cleanly.

## TIER 2: DESIGN RULES (Reference)

> **Design rules are in the specialist agents, NOT here.**

| Task         | Read                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Web UI/UX    | `.agent/frontend-specialist.md` |
| Mobile UI/UX | `.agent/mobile-developer.md`    |

**These agents contain:**

- Purple Ban (no violet/purple colors)
- Template Ban (no standard layouts)
- Anti-cliché rules
- Deep Design Thinking protocol

> 🔴 **For design work:** Open and READ the agent file. Rules are there.
