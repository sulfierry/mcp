description: Deep academic research for antibody design campaigns — target analysis, literature review, prior art search, epitope identification. Uses an 8-phase pipeline with quality gates and persistent memory. Use this skill whenever researching a protein target, starting a new design campaign, investigating prior art, analyzing epitopes, reviewing literature for design strategy, or when the user mentions target research, literature search, or prior art in the context of protein/antibody design.

# BY Research Skill

Thorough target research before design prevents wasted compute and failed campaigns.
This skill defines an 8-phase pipeline that retrieves, validates, and packages research
findings with quality gates and anti-drift checkpoints at every stage.

## When to Use

- Starting a new design campaign (target research is always step 1)
- Investigating a protein target before committing to a design modality
- Searching for prior art (existing antibodies, nanobodies, binders)
- Analyzing epitope regions and binding sites from literature + structure
- Literature review for design strategy or scaffold selection
- Resuming interrupted research (checkpoint recovery)

## Research Depth

Auto-select depth based on how well-studied the target is. If uncertain, start with
Standard and let quality gates decide whether to iterate.

| Depth | When | Phases | Time | Min Sources |
|-------|------|--------|------|-------------|
| Quick | Well-studied target (TNF-alpha, PD-L1, HER2) | 1-3-5-8 | 5 min | 5+ |
| Standard | Moderate target (some known binders) | All 8 | 15 min | 10+ |
| Deep | Novel target (no known binders) | All 8 + iteration | 30 min | 15+ |
| **UltraDeep** | **Extremely novel (0 PDB, 0 SAbDab, novel organism/modality)** | **All 8 + 2-3 iterations of 3-7 + cross-species homolog search** | **45+ min** | **20+** |

Indicators for depth selection:
- **Quick**: >10 PDB structures, >5 SAbDab antibodies, >50 PubMed papers
- **Standard**: 2-10 PDB structures, 1-5 SAbDab antibodies, 10-50 papers
- **Deep**: 0-1 PDB structures, 0 SAbDab antibodies, <10 papers
- **UltraDeep**: 0 PDB structures, 0 SAbDab entries, AND any of: novel organism (not human/mouse), novel modality (bispecific, peptide-protein hybrid), or user explicitly requests "deep dive" / "thorough research"

### UltraDeep Mode

UltraDeep triggers when:
- Zero PDB structures for the target
- Zero SAbDab entries
- Novel organism (not human/mouse)
- Novel modality request (e.g., bispecific, peptide-protein hybrid)
- User explicitly requests "deep dive" or "thorough research"

UltraDeep adds the following on top of Deep:
- **Cross-species homolog search**: Find similar proteins in other organisms with known binders via `mcp__by-research__research_find_similar_targets`, expanding to orthologs across species
- **Molecular docking literature review**: Targeted PubMed/bioRxiv search for docking studies on the target or homologs
- **Patent landscape scan**: PubMed patent filter search to identify prior IP and freedom-to-operate considerations
- **2-3 iterations of Phase 3-7**: Retrieve-critique loop runs 2-3 times (vs 1 for Deep) to maximize coverage
- **Minimum 20 sources, 5+ HIGH confidence findings** required to pass quality gates

## 8-Phase Research Pipeline

### Phase 1: SCOPE

Define the research boundaries before searching anything.

Write `research/scope.json` to the campaign directory:
```json
{
  "target_name": "TNF-alpha",
  "organism": "Homo sapiens",
  "uniprot_accession": null,
  "therapeutic_area": "Autoimmune / inflammation",
  "modality_preference": "VHH",
  "known_information": ["Homotrimeric cytokine", "Multiple approved antibodies"],
  "gaps_to_fill": ["Novel epitope regions", "VHH-specific binding data"],
  "research_depth": "quick",
  "started_at": "2026-03-23T10:00:00Z"
}
```

Scope comes from user input and quick heuristics. Do not search databases yet.

### Phase 2: PLAN

Create a research strategy based on the scope.

Write `research/research_plan.json`:
```json
{
  "database_queries": [
    {"database": "UniProt+PDB", "tool": "research_get_target_info", "query": "TNF-alpha"},
    {"database": "PubMed+bioRxiv", "tool": "research_search_prior_art", "query": "TNF-alpha"},
    {"database": "SAbDab", "tool": "research_analyze_known_binders", "query": "TNF-alpha"},
    {"database": "UniProt BLAST", "tool": "research_find_similar_targets", "query": "P01375"}
  ],
  "priority_order": ["structure", "literature", "antibodies", "homologs"],
  "depth_per_source": "standard",
  "estimated_time_minutes": 15
}
```

Priority: structure data first (most reliable for interface analysis), then literature,
then existing binders, then homologs with known binders.

### Phase 3: RETRIEVE

Execute all searches. Run tools in parallel where possible:

1. `mcp__by-research__research_get_target_info` — UniProt protein info + PDB structures
2. `mcp__by-research__research_search_prior_art` — PubMed + bioRxiv literature
3. `mcp__by-research__research_analyze_known_binders` — SAbDab antibody database
4. `mcp__by-research__research_find_similar_targets` — homologs with known binders

Save ALL results to `research/sources.json` with credibility scores:

| Source Type | Credibility | Examples |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Crystal structure (PDB) | 0.95 | X-ray, cryo-EM structures |
| Peer-reviewed paper | 0.90 | Nature, Science, PNAS, JMB |
| bioRxiv/medRxiv preprint | 0.70 | Unreviewed manuscripts |
| Computational prediction | 0.50 | AlphaFold models, docking studies |
| Blog/press release | 0.30 | Company announcements |

Each source entry in `sources.json`:
```json
{
  "id": "src_001",
  "type": "pdb_structure",
  "credibility": 0.95,
  "identifier": "7S4S",
  "title": "Crystal structure of PD-L1 in complex with VHH",
  "key_findings": ["Interface residues: Y56, R113, A121"],
  "retrieved_from": "research_get_target_info",
  "retrieved_at": "2026-03-23T10:02:00Z"
}
```

**Quality gate**: After Phase 3, check source count against depth thresholds.
If below minimum, re-run with broader queries (drop "antibody" filter, expand date range).

### Phase 4: TRIANGULATE

Cross-validate findings across sources:

- Do structural data (PDB interface residues) match literature claims about binding sites?
- Do known antibody epitopes from SAbDab agree with PubMed-reported epitopes?
- Are binding affinity values consistent across publications?

Assign confidence to each finding:
- **HIGH**: 3+ independent sources agree
- **MEDIUM**: 2 sources agree
- **LOW**: Single source only
- **CONTRADICTED**: Sources disagree (flag explicitly with both sides)

Write `research/validated_findings.json`:
```json
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "claim": "Residues Y56, R113 are critical for PD-1 binding",
      "confidence": "HIGH",
      "supporting_sources": ["src_001", "src_003", "src_007"],
      "contradicting_sources": [],
      "notes": ""
    }
  ],
  "contradictions": [],
  "summary": "12 findings: 5 HIGH, 4 MEDIUM, 3 LOW, 0 CONTRADICTED"
}
```

### Phase 5: SYNTHESIZE

Structure findings into a coherent narrative covering:

1. **Target overview** — function, structure, therapeutic relevance
2. **Known binders** — existing antibodies/nanobodies from SAbDab + literature
3. **Epitope analysis** — consensus hotspot residues, interface character
4. **Design strategy** — recommended modality, scaffolds, campaign tier
5. **Risk assessment** — target difficulty, expected hit rate, key risks

This is the first draft of the research report. Write it as structured prose with
inline citations (e.g., "[src_001]").

### Phase 6: CRITIQUE

Challenge the synthesis using three distinct review personas. Each persona applies a
different lens to the research. The critique output must label every concern with the
persona that raised it (e.g., `[Skeptical Practitioner]`, `[Adversarial Reviewer]`,
`[Implementation Engineer]`).

#### Persona 1: Skeptical Practitioner
Challenges evidence quality and reproducibility:
- Would this replicate? Are the key binding studies based on single experiments or independent replication?
- Is the crystal structure resolution good enough? (>3.0 A structures may have unreliable interface contacts)
- Are we extrapolating from too few data points? (e.g., one mutagenesis study defining the entire epitope)
- Has this epitope actually been validated experimentally, or is it only computationally predicted?
- Are the reported affinity values (Kd, IC50) from comparable assay formats?

#### Persona 2: Adversarial Reviewer
Attacks logical coherence and reasoning gaps:
- Do the SAbDab results contradict the literature claims? (e.g., known antibodies binding different epitopes than claimed consensus)
- Is the recommended scaffold justified by evidence or just popular? (e.g., defaulting to caplacizumab without target-specific rationale)
- Are there alternative interpretations of the structural data? (e.g., crystal packing artifacts vs true biological interfaces)
- What is the weakest link in the reasoning chain from evidence to design recommendation?
- Have we cherry-picked supportive studies while ignoring contradictory ones?

#### Persona 3: Implementation Engineer
Questions practical feasibility within the BY toolchain:
- Can BoltzGen actually handle this epitope topology? (e.g., concave pockets, disordered loops, glycosylated surfaces)
- Is the compute budget sufficient for the target difficulty? (novel targets may need Exploratory tier, not Standard)
- Are the recommended scaffolds available in the BoltzGen template library? (check against known VHH/Fab scaffold sets)
- What is the fallback if this approach fails? (alternative modality, different scaffolds, or relaxed hotspot constraints)
- Are there known failure modes for similar targets in the literature?

#### Critique Output

Write `research/critique.json`:
```json
{
  "concerns": [
    {
      "persona": "Skeptical Practitioner",
      "concern": "Primary epitope mapping based on single mutagenesis study (src_004)",
      "severity": "HIGH",
      "affected_findings": ["finding_003"],
      "resolution": "Search for independent validation of residues Y56, R113"
    },
    {
      "persona": "Adversarial Reviewer",
      "concern": "SAbDab antibodies bind loop region, contradicting our beta-sheet epitope recommendation",
      "severity": "CRITICAL",
      "affected_findings": ["finding_001", "finding_005"],
      "resolution": "Re-examine epitope consensus, consider both regions"
    },
    {
      "persona": "Implementation Engineer",
      "concern": "Target has N-linked glycosylation at N78 adjacent to proposed hotspots",
      "severity": "MEDIUM",
      "affected_findings": ["finding_002"],
      "resolution": "Check if BoltzGen models glycans; if not, shift hotspots away from N78"
    }
  ],
  "critical_gaps": [],
  "summary": "3 concerns raised: 0 CRITICAL, 1 HIGH, 1 MEDIUM, 1 LOW"
}
```

Severity levels:
- **CRITICAL**: Fundamental flaw that could invalidate the design strategy. Requires return to Phase 3.
- **HIGH**: Significant gap that weakens confidence. Should be addressed in Phase 7.
- **MEDIUM**: Notable concern worth documenting. Address if feasible in Phase 7.
- **LOW**: Minor issue for awareness. Document in the final report's Uncertainties section.

If the critique identifies any CRITICAL concerns, return to Phase 3 for targeted retrieval.
"Critical gap" = a finding rated HIGH confidence that lacks structural validation,
or a design recommendation based only on LOW confidence findings.

### Phase 7: REFINE

Address critique findings:

- Run additional targeted searches to fill gaps
- Strengthen weak claims with additional sources
- Explicitly note remaining uncertainties (do not hide them)
- Update confidence levels in `validated_findings.json`
- Add new sources to `sources.json`

### Phase 8: PACKAGE

Write final outputs to the campaign directory:

1. **`research/research.md`** — formatted report (see Output Format below)
2. **`research/recommended_hotspots.json`** — residue list for the design agent
3. **`research/design_recommendation.json`** — modality, scaffolds, tier, parameters
4. Update campaign state with research summary

## Anti-Drift Checkpoints

After completing each phase, write progress to `research/research_progress.json`:

```json
{
  "campaign_id": "tnf_alpha_20260323_001",
  "current_phase": 3,
  "completed_phases": [1, 2],
  "phase_outputs": {
    "1": "scope.json",
    "2": "research_plan.json"
  },
  "sources_count": 12,
  "quality_gate_passed": true,
  "research_depth": "standard",
  "started_at": "2026-03-23T10:00:00Z",
  "last_checkpoint": "2026-03-23T10:05:00Z"
}
```

**Resuming from checkpoint**: If context is compacted mid-research, read
`research/research_progress.json` first. Load all phase outputs listed in
`phase_outputs`. Continue from the phase after the last completed one.

Short task cycles matter: each phase is a discrete, reviewable step. Do not combine
phases or skip checkpoints. The checkpoint file is the source of truth for progress.

## Anti-Hallucination Rules

These are non-negotiable:
- NEVER fabricate PDB IDs, UniProt accessions, PMIDs, or DOIs
- NEVER invent binding affinity values (Kd, IC50, EC50)
- NEVER claim a crystal structure exists without PDB verification
- NEVER present computational predictions as experimental facts
- If a search returns no results, say "no data found" — do not guess
- All claims in research.md must trace to a source in sources.json
- Flag computational predictions explicitly: "predicted (AlphaFold)" vs "experimental (X-ray)"

For detailed methodology including database priority, query construction, and
cross-validation rules, read `references/methodology.md`.
